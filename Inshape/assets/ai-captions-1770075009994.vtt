00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.609
Remember that prevention plus wellness programs are designed to help

1
00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:06.320
youth and young adults look and feel more active,

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.630
fit and healthy

3
00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.390
using a three-step brief intervention process.

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.449
Here we will learn what to do before you implement your program.

5
00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:16.700
To present your program,

6
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.360
you will follow along with the script

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.549
while using the PowerPoint slides.

8
00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:21.299
Therefore,

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.559
it is key that you have the program manual and slides with you before the lesson.

10
00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.639
Practice the scripts allowed prior to presenting to others.

11
00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.020
You will also need copies of the screening survey,

12
00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:32.098
goal plan contract,

13
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.369
seven-day calendar log,

14
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.569
instructor survey,

15
00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:36.720
and the pre and post-test surveys,

16
00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:38.729
unless using the online surveys.

17
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.099
Make sure to get the PowerPoint slides and other

18
00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:44.939
digital download materials from your organization before you begin.

19
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.360
Before you present your PPW program,

20
00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:52.560
sign up online at preventionplusweness.com

21
00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.759
to receive notices of invaluable prevention plus wellness resources,

22
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.400
research,

23
00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:58.340
and webinars.

24
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.799
This will help to ensure you experience the greatest program reach,

25
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.639
effectiveness,

26
00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:03.619
and sustainability.

27
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.080
Print copies of all the program and evaluation materials

28
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.889
from the digital download file before beginning the lesson.

29
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.510
Again,

30
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:15.230
your prevention organization will receive this digital

31
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.010
download folder when they purchase the program.

32
00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:20.110
If you plan to present your program virtually,

33
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.110
you can use the additional screening survey and goal plan

34
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.809
slides that show links for participants to access these materials.

35
00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:30.580
Immediately before beginning the lesson,

36
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.120
administer either the online or paper pre-test survey

37
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.279
to participants.

38
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.589
We recommend the online survey as you will avoid having to hand enter the data.

39
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.019
One month after the lesson,

40
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.050
implement the post-test survey to assess 30-day

41
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.680
substance use and healthy behavior changes.

42
00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:48.860
If you can't provide the 1 month follow-up,

43
00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:51.779
implement the post-test immediately after the lesson

44
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.839
to assess risk and protective factor changes.
