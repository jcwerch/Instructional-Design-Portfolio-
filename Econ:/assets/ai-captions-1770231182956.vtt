In this video,

1
00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:03.950
we'll quickly review how the Federal Reserve Bank sets interest

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.909
rates and how those interest rates influence the macroeconomy.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.409
Then,

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.909
we'll apply this knowledge to a

5
00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.250
real-world scenario by interpreting Fed macroeconomic data

6
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.750
and giving a policy recommendation to the Fed

7
00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.350
on whether to lower or raise interest rates.

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.379
Remember that the Fed has two mandates or jobs.

9
00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:25.149
The first is to keep inflation rates low and stable,

10
00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:26.979
roughly 2% per year.

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.600
The second is maximum employment.

12
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.180
Make sure as many people who want to have jobs can have jobs,

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.099
as long as this doesn't conflict

14
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.400
with the Fed's price stability goals.

15
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.250
So how does the Fed achieve these goals?

16
00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:44.610
The Fed has the ability to set a target federal funds rate,

17
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.729
or the rate banks charge to lend to each other overnight.

18
00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:48.259
Remember,

19
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.060
in the past,

20
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.689
the Fed would influence the supply of bank reserves or cash.

21
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.979
Banks have on hand,

22
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.639
but

23
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.400
today,

24
00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:56.580
banks have a large amount.

25
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.389
Of reserves.

26
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.630
So instead of influencing supply,

27
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:04.230
the Fed influences demand by paying interest on those bank reserves.

28
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.419
The Fed pays banks interest to hold cash

29
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:11.080
using this rate plus the overnight repo rate and discount rate.

30
00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:13.919
The Fed can select a target federal funds rate.

31
00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:17.779
The Fed's target interest rate

32
00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:21.510
acts as a floor or lower bound interest rate in the economy.

33
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.730
That's because lending money to the Fed is basically risk-free.

34
00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:26.989
If you are a bank,

35
00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.540
why lend to anyone else at a lower rate

36
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.510
when you can just lend to the Fed and know you'll be paid back?

37
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.059
So,

38
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.360
if the Fed sets the target rate at 3.5%,

39
00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.300
That means rates in the economy typically won't be lower than that,

40
00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.230
and for consumers or businesses are usually higher.

41
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.879
For example,

42
00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:48.180
the rate the bank will lend you to buy a home is usually about 2 to 3% higher,

43
00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.819
or

44
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.680
6.22% today,

45
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.290
and credit card rates are much higher at almost 20%.

46
00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.750
So,

47
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.220
the Fed sets this base rate as low

48
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.500
or as high as it thinks necessary,

49
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.419
and then all the other rates follow.

50
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.860
But

51
00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.879
how do interest rates affect things in the economy?

52
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.508
One of the main ways is through investment spending.

53
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.639
When interest rates go lower from I1 to I2,

54
00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.910
the quantity of investment rises from L1 to L2.

55
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.559
Businesses take advantage of cheaper borrowing costs

56
00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.759
to expand their businesses by building factories,

57
00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:21.589
buying machines,

58
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.940
or building out new stores.

59
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.539
When investment demand increases,

60
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.710
so does our aggregate demand curve.

61
00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.309
It shifts to the right.

62
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.809
This leads to a new equilibrium point in the economy where real GDP

63
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.070
Y2,

64
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.380
and the price level,

65
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.250
P2,

66
00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.350
are both higher.

67
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.149
Therefore,

68
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.610
lowering interest rates stimulates economic activity.

69
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.100
Raising both economic output as well as the price level.

70
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.369
This is called expansionary monetary policy

71
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.220
because it expands the economy.

72
00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.000
The Fed would typically use this policy when real

73
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.899
GDP was low and unemployment was relatively high.

74
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.360
This would help fulfill the Fed's role by trying

75
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.240
to bring the economy back to maximum employment.

76
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.080
On the flip side,

77
00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.350
an increase in interest rates leads to a decrease in investment spending.

78
00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.130
This causes aggregate demand to decrease

79
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.240
as business borrow less money and invest less.

80
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.669
The aggregate demand curve shifts to the left,

81
00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:23.509
and a new equilibrium is reached where both real GDP and the price level are lower.

82
00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.630
This is called contractionary monetary policy

83
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.509
and is used when the price level

84
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.210
or inflation in the economy is too high.

85
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.910
In conclusion,

86
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.009
the Fed chooses what level of interest rates it wants to target

87
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.610
using the vast amounts of economic data it has at its disposal

88
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.250
that give it a picture of the current health of the economy.

89
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.130
If the price level or inflation is going up too quickly or higher than its target,

90
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.910
it will use contractionary monetary policy to bring inflation down.

91
00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:53.054
To a lower level.

92
00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:56.065
And if employment levels in the economy are lower than it would like,

93
00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:58.845
it will use expansionary monetary policy

94
00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:01.365
to push employment back up to a higher level.

95
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.824
These are big decisions that the Fed governors don't take lightly.

96
00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:07.955
The state of the entire economy and therefore

97
00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:10.785
US citizens' livelihoods rest on these decisions.
